Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

user will select a value and then the computer will randomly select a value

how does a user win this Game = rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats Paper

what data do i need to track = wins, loses, and ties - create variables for those

how do i make the computer randomly select one of these three values

object called math which has methods on it, one is .floor and the other is .random

var computerChoice = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
                index  0         1         2

once we have user and computer selection we need to compare the two values to see if user won, lost, or tied

use if statements to compare

if user wins - wins++

alerts, prompts, and confirms, variables, randomly choose a value from array based on index number, if statements, logical operators

logical operators && ||
